              Michael is tasked with improving team dynamics in a department that has been experiencing conflicts and low productivity. He decides to use Psyche as a tool to better understand the team members' personalities and work styles.
  
              Michael sets up a company account on Psyche and invites all team members to take a series of assessments. He carefully explains the purpose of the exercise and assures everyone that the results will be used constructively to improve team collaboration.
